# Streetview-panorama-scraping

 This module is a fork of https://github.com/FluffyMaguro/Streetview-panorama-scraping, with support for python 3.12, as well as added argument support.


 This module helps you scrape panoramas from Google's streetview for given area.

 Scraping is done asynchronously using aiohttp and asyncio packages.

The module is built upon and modifies streetview module - https://github.com/robolyst/streetview

# Usage
1. Install required modules: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `1_get_panoid_info.py` with options. Running it will save data for panormas and generates a map of panorama locations.

The options:
```bash
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --file FILE           Name of the output file
  --zoom ZOOM           Zoom level of the map
  --lat LAT             Latitude of the center of the area
  --lon LON             Longitude of the center of the area
  --radius RADIUS       Radius of the area in km
  --resolution RESOLUTION
                        How many dummy points are searched, lower makes it faster, but some panoramas will be missed
```

3. Running `2_download_panoramas.py [json_file_name]`, and specifying the generated json file generated by script 1 will start downloading panoramas to a  `panoramas/` directory
